# Push-To-GitHub-in-1-command
Instead of 3 commands, I write this to push code in only 1 command :)) 
<br>The name of commit will be: dd//mm/yy hh/mm/ss (you can change the name of commit by changing code)
<br>Ex:

GitHub (of course, you can't push if you don't have :)) )

Make sure you linked GitHub with your code editors. Better if you have known how to push code to GitHub before. 


# How to use
After coding, you want to push code to GitHub. Download this (in zip) and Extract or you can add a file with code in [this](https://github.com/104-wonohfor/Push-To-GitHub-in-1-command/blob/badcca74dd392dfb15d637c09786a85ef711ff9c/Push.py).  
Run this file in terminal by typing: 
```diff
- Ô∏èpy push.py:
``` 
(If you add file by yourself, make sure name of that file is 'Push.py' or you can change code in terminal)
